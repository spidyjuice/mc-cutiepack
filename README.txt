this is a minecraft resource pack with sprite art by spidyjuice and some sound effects and music tracks from other media, as well as other tweaks. it's a personal project without any goal other than to enhance my own minecraft experience. the project file size is big because of the music files if you didn't notice :o

NOTICE: this pack comes in the format of later minecraft resource packs, but comes with a script to convert it back/forth between post/pre-1.7.2 compatibility.

in minecraft 1.7.2 mojang made the frucked up decision of moving around some directories in resource packs. On windows execute 'fix_1.6_to_1.7.bat' to update the pack to the modern folder structure or 'fix_1.7_to_1.6.bat' to retrograde. On linux and mac, execute the corespondent .sh script.
